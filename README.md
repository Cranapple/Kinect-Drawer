# Kinect-Drawer
This program allows you to draw with your hand using a xbox 360 kinect. It's been a long time since I created this project, 
so I apologize for weird code or bugs. When the project was made, for some reason the dlls and java libraries didn't work 
properly so it would only run on my computer, even if I packaged everything together.
A lot of the code here comes from the J4K library, which you can dowload for yourself here.
